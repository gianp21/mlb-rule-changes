### MLB Rule Changes and their Effects on the Game

As a former player and avid fan of baseball, I wanted to use my data analysis skills to dig into overall league and team stats over the last few years and determine if league-wide rule changes have had significant effects on the game as a whole.

The following are the rule changes I wanted to focus on:
- # Pitch Clock
  -- implemented in hopes of shortening the length of games and keeping up a high pace of play
- # Larger bases
  -- hopefully will encourage more base-stealing
- # Defensive Shift Limits
  -- with less defensive shifts, the hope is that it will lead to more hits and runners on base (more exciting games)

I'll be using data scraped from the Statcast and Fangraphs webpages to compare the 2023 season stats (the season these rules were implemented) against the last few years. The data will include stats at the league, team, and player level.

I'll also be updating this repo as I ask myself new questions (or if my friends do) and gain new insights into how the wonderful game of baseball is affected by these new rules in the future.
